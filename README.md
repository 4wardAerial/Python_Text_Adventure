# Python Game

---
### What? A game?

Ok, calling it a game might be an exaggeration. This is just a small side project made by me to learn a bit more about python and GitHub.
I decided on a small game because I've already tried multiple times to do it before (on C++) but either failed or just abandoned it midway through,
so now I've commited myself to actually finish it for once, hence this repository: *I wanted to get serious*.

**Note:** Don't expect good code, specially because I'm doing this as I learn, so there's quite possible a lot of bad decisions being made.

### Ok but what is it about?

The game consists of text, basically. It's a simple and happy adventure in a fantasy land with no secrets whatsoever (*wink*).
If it had images it would be like one of those point & click games, so bear that in mind and expect a bit of backtracking.

In your adventure, you may encounter:
* Multiple endings
* Multiple game overs
* Multiple gory, bloody and _very_ descriptive death messages
* Beautiful and high quality art 
* Fun and interesting unnamed characters
* A singular potato
* A rift in time
* Bad code I think

### Versions and Updates

I don't actually know if this is the right place to do it, but since I don't know better:

###### **Version 1.0.0:**
* Uploaded everything I had done to this point
* 8 endings
* Working shop, farm and strange house paths
* Working death and respawn

###### **Version 1.1.0:**
* WIP (check to do list)

### How do I play it?

I don't know yet lol. I guess you could just get the code and run it? That's how this site works, right? (_genuine question_)

I'll try to figure this out better eventually.

### Shouldn't this file be more useful?

Probably. But since I'm learning, I get a pass.

### License and Credits

Me I guess? And kudos for [this site](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/convert-images-to-ascii-art/) that handled the ASCII image conversion.
